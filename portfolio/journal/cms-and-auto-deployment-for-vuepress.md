# Content management and auto deployment for Vuepress

Let's check out how we can automatically deploy our vuepress sites and manage the content from within Forestry.

### Preparing our vuepress site

We need to create a `package.json` file in the root of our project, this will include the build command and list vuepress as a dependency.

    {
      "name": "project-name",
      "scripts": {
        "site:build": "vuepress build"
      },
      "author": "Nichlas W. Andersen",
      "license": "MIT",
      "dependencies": {
        "vuepress": "^0.14.1"
      }
    }

Now, push it up to your remote git repository.

### Deploying with Netlify

1. Create a new site in Netlify and import your repository.
2. Set the build command to: `npm run site:build`
3. Set the publish directory to `portfolio/.vuepress/dist`

### Manage your content with Forestry

Well, not much to do here really, this theme is pre-configured and works out of the box with Forestry. Create an account at [Forestry](https://forestry.io "Forestry") and import your repository.

That's it, that's all. Enjoy your new site!
